	\item \question{What is Python? What are the benefits of using Python?}
	
	 \answer{
	 	
	 	\newlist{
			\item Python is a general-purpose programming language that has a simple, easy-to-
			learn syntax that emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of
			program maintenance. Moreover, the language is capable of scripting, is
			completely open-source, and supports third-party packages encouraging
			modularity and code reuse.
			\item Its high-level data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamicbinding, attract a huge community of developers for Rapid ApplicationDevelopment and deployment.
